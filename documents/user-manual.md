## To start

Download the newest verion of the game from [Here](https://github.com/Tseipii89/ot-harjoitustyo/releases) (at the time of writing V2.0)

### Configuration

To use the different difficulty settings, you must include the config.properties file in the root folder. It contains the difficulty settings for easy, medium and hard difficulties. 

For example the easy -level is configured as follows:
```
EasyspaceBetweenPipes = 300
EasysizeOfHole = 175
EasyspeedOfPipes = 2
```

## To start the game

After downloading the JAR -file you can start the game with the command 

```
java -jar FallyBird-(version).jar
```

Unfortunately the I couldn't get the config.properties file to work with the JAR -file. So if you want to also include the difficulty settings, you should clone the git repo (the command is "git clone git@github.com:Tseipii89/ot-harjoitustyo.git"), and run "mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=main.Main"
