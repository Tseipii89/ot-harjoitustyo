# FlappyBird #

This is a school project for the course "Programming techniques". The focus is on agile development, automated testing, proper architecture and version control. The FlappyBird game is really just a way to apply different things I've learned.

FlappyBird is a game where you try to fly through pipes with a bouncing bird. The up-arrow bounces the bird a little bit up. The game ends if the bird hits any pipes or bottom of the screen. More info at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird>. A little side note, the game was earning 50,000$ a day as a free mobile game!!! That is just crazy!
